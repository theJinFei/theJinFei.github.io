## 题目描述
> Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.
<br>
The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
<br>
The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.
<br>
If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.
<br>    
If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.

## NOTE
- Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
- Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 − 1) or INT_MIN (−231) is returned.

## Example1:
 
>       Input: "   -42"
        Output: -42
        Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.

## Example2:
 
>       Input: "words and 987"
        Output: 0
        Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.

## Example3:
 
>       Input: "-91283472332"
        Output: -2147483648
        Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.Thefore INT_MIN (−2^31) is returned.

## 解题思路
- 根据题意，首先判断是不是连续的空格
- 然后判断正负号
- 最后在生成最后的value时，看是否溢出了（跟INT_MAX进行对比，如果溢出了，并且是负数，返回 INT_MIN,否则返回 INT_MAX）


```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int myAtoi(string str) {
        
        if(str.size() == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        int i = 0;
        int sign = 1;
        unsigned long value = 0;
        while(i < str.size() && str[i] == ' '){
              i++;
        }
        if(str[i] == '-' || str[i] == '+'){
            if(str[i] == '-'){
                sign = -1;
            }
            i++;
        }
        for(; i < str.size() && str[i] >= '0' && str[i] <= '9'; i++){
            value = value * 10 + (str[i] - '0');
            if(value > INT_MAX){
                return sign == -1 ? INT_MIN : INT_MAX;
            }
        }
        return value * sign;
    }
};
```
