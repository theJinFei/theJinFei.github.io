## 题目描述
> There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].
<br>
You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
<br>
Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

## Example1:
 
>       Input: 
        gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
        cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

        Output: 3

        Explanation:
        Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
        Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
        Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
        Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
        Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
        Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
        Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.


## Example2:
 
>       Input: 
        gas  = [2,3,4]
        cost = [3,4,3]

        Output: -1

        Explanation:
        You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
        Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
        Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
        Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
        You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
        Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

## NOTE
- If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
- Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
- Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.

## 解题思路

- 给你一堆加油站，和去每个加油站的消耗，要求找到从某个位置开始能够顺时针遍历一圈。
- 记录最后一个加起来小于零的索引，然后返回这个索引+1就是答案了。
- 从0开始以其为起点实验，累加 restGas += gas[i] - cost[i]
- 一旦在 i 处遇到restGas<0，那么就说明当前选择的起点beg不行，需要重新选择，此时我们不应该回去使用 beg+1 作为新起点，遍历到 size-1 处就可以结束了，如果找到了可能的起点，我们还要进行验证，走一遍(total)。
- 其实本质就是：这个起点将路径分为前后两段，前段总的余量为负，即油不够用
- 要想有解，那么后段油量应该为正，此时才可能有解，我们要做的就是找到这个分割点作为起点，然后再验证一下；
- 反之，如果前段就为正了，那么显然可以直接选择前面的点为起点；如果整段加起来都是负的，那么无解。



```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int sum = 0;
        int rest = 0;
        int start = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < gas.size(); i++){
            rest += gas[i] - cost[i];
            sum += gas[i] - cost[i];
            if(sum < 0){
                start = i + 1;
                sum = 0;
            }
        }
        return rest < 0 ? -1 : start;
    }
};
```
